# DRLND Project 1: Navigation

## Introduction

The goal of this project is to navigate an environment and collect as many yellow bananas as possible while avoiding blue bananas.

The environment is built using Unity.


### Rewards
In this environment the agent will receive a reward of +1 for every yellow banana and a reward of -1 for every blue banana.

### States
The state space has 37 dimensions and contains the agent's velocity, along with ray-based perception of objects around the agent's forward direction.

### Actions
The four discrete actions that are available are:

* `0` : move forward
* `1` : move backward
* `2` : turn left
* `3` : turn right


### Success Criteria
In order to solve the environment, the agent must get an average score of >=13 over 100 consecutive episodes.

* Foo
